                        <summary>I'm missing an item from my order, what do I do?</summary>
                        <div>We're sorry there's an item missing from your order. Before contacting our Customer Care team, we recommend checking the following: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>We may have sent your items in separate parcels so please check your emails to see if any of your items will be arriving separately.
                                    You can also check if your order has been split into more than one parcel by logging into 'My Account' and checking my orders.
                                    The item/s you ordered may have been out of stock. It's worth checking your emails (including your junk/spam) to see if we've sent you an email about this.</li>
                                <li>If you’ve placed multiple orders within a few days of each other that qualify for free delivery and are being shipped to the same delivery address, your orders may have been combined and split across multiple parcels. You’ll be able to see whether they’ve been shipped together if the tracking information for each of the orders you’ve placed is the same.</li>
                                <li>If some of your items are being shipped from another ELPIS warehouse, their delivery times may be slightly different to those items being delivered from other warehouses we have, so it's worth checking your expected delivery date and tracking in the 'My Orders' section of your ELPIS account.</li>
                                <li>If you have an item missing from your order, please let us know within 30 days of your order being delivered and we’ll do our best to help you.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </div>
